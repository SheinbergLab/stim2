This directory is for site-specific configuration scripts.

Any *.tcl files here will be sourced at startup before the
standard configuration calculations, allowing you to override
defaults like:

    set distance_to_monitor 55.0

Files are sourced in alphabetical order.

This directory is preserved across package updates.
